Spindle
=======

Spindle is a library and code generation tool developed at Foursquare for representing data stored in MongoDB. It's
based heavily on Apache Thrift, so understanding some Thrift fundamentals is important. However, most of Spindle is
custom Scala code generation developed to work with Thrift models.
